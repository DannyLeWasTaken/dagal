# DAGAL
**D**anny's **A**wesome **G**raphics **A**bstraction **L**ayer

---
DAGAL abstracts Vulkan and is mainly only used by me.

DAGAL is split into two parts:
- **Main** - Contains only abstractions for Vulkan, but nothing more
- **Utility** - Contains utility for Vulkan such as render graphs, lifetime management, etc.


## To-dos (we will never finish them)
- - -
- [ ] Render Graph
- [ ] Lifetime management using timeline semaphores
- [ ] egui integration
